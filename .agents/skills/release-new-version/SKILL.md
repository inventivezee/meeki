# Release a New Desktop Version

Use this for stable desktop releases. A stable release must come from `main`, after the changelog for the computed version is present, accurate, validated, and merged.

## Core Rule

Do not trigger a stable release from an unmerged branch. First make the changelog up to date, merge that changelog change to `main`, then run the stable release from `main`.

## QA Gate

After the changelog is merged to `main`, read and run
`../qa-critical-ux/SKILL.md` against that final commit. Require a recorded PASS
for both:

- native Dev QA pinned with `ANARLOG_QA_GIT_SHA` and a helper manifest with
  `git_dirty=false`
- the run-scoped staging artifact whose Actions head SHA exactly matches the
  Dev manifest's `git_head_sha`

The manifest's `git_head_sha` is the exact final `main` commit, including the
changelog, not a synthetic GitButler workspace HEAD. The report must include
that Dev SHA, staging run URL and head SHA, staging artifact SHA-256, and the
critical checklist results. Any failure, missing evidence, SHA mismatch,
rebuild, or later source change blocks stable unless the user explicitly
waives that specific gate.

This release path currently approves macOS only. The patched CloudSync vendor
bundle was rebuilt and cancellation-tested for Apple Silicon and Intel, but
not for Windows, Linux, or mobile. Before opening any of those release lanes,
rebuild the bundled native library for every target architecture and pass the
QA skill's equivalent stalled-network, logout, configuration cleanup/init,
worker-drain, and immediate-local-write cancellation gates. Do not treat the
macOS artifacts or Rust-only tests as cross-platform approval.

## Preflight

1. Inspect the workflow before assuming release behavior:

```bash
sed -n '1,280p' .github/workflows/desktop_cd.yaml
```

2. Check the version inputs that the workflow will use:

```bash
doxxer --config doxxer.desktop.toml current
doxxer --config doxxer.desktop.toml next patch
```

Stable desktop releases use `next patch` unless the user explicitly asks for an override version.

3. Identify the latest stable desktop tag and the commits that will ship:

```bash
git fetch --tags --force
git tag -l 'desktop_v*' --sort=-v:refname | grep -E '^desktop_v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$' | head -n1
git log --oneline <latest-desktop-tag>..HEAD
```

Use read-only `git` commands for inspection. If the workspace is on `gitbutler/workspace`, use the `but` skill for commits, pushes, PRs, merges, and other write operations.

## Changelog Gate

The changelog is the release gate. Before releasing:

1. Open `packages/changelog/content/AGENTS.md` and follow its instructions.
2. Confirm `packages/changelog/content/<next-patch-version>.md` exists.
3. Compare the file against the desktop user-facing changes since the latest `desktop_v*` tag.
4. If the changelog is missing or incomplete, update it before release.

Changelog entries should be worth reading for app users. Exclude internal-only refactors, CI changes, infra noise, and implementation details unless they explain a user-visible change.

Each changelog file must include:

```md
---
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
summary: "One concise, user-facing sentence for the changelog index preview."
---
```

After editing the changelog, run:

```bash
pnpm exec dprint fmt
pnpm -F @hypr/changelog typecheck
```

## Merge to Main

Only after the changelog is accurate and validation passes:

1. Commit the changelog change.
2. Open or update the changelog PR.
3. Wait for CI and required review state to be clear.
4. Merge the changelog PR to `main`.
5. Verify `main` contains `packages/changelog/content/<version>.md`.
6. Record the resulting `main` SHA and complete the QA Gate against that exact
   commit before triggering stable.

If using GitButler, prefer:

```bash
but diff
but commit chore/release-changelog -c -m "Update desktop release changelog

Refresh the desktop changelog for the next stable release." --changes <ids>
but pr new <branch-id> -t
```

Use actual IDs from `but diff` / `but status -fv`; do not invent IDs.

## Trigger Stable Release

After the changelog merge and QA Gate pass on the same `main` SHA, verify
`main` has not moved, then trigger the stable desktop workflow from `main`:

```bash
gh workflow run desktop_cd.yaml \
  --ref main \
  -f channel=stable \
  -f publish=true \
  -f version=
```

Then watch the run:

```bash
gh run list --workflow desktop_cd.yaml --branch main --limit 5
gh run view <run-id> --json headSha,url
gh run watch <run-id>
```

The run's `headSha` must equal the Dev/staging candidate SHA. A mismatch blocks
acceptance even if the workflow succeeds.

The stable workflow should:

- compute the version from `doxxer --config doxxer.desktop.toml next patch` when no explicit version is supplied
- build both Apple Silicon and Intel macOS artifacts
- draft, upload, and publish the CrabNebula release when `publish=true`
- create or update `desktop_v<version>`
- create the GitHub release pointing to `https://anarlog.so/changelog/<version>`

## Final Checks

Before reporting success, capture:

- computed stable version
- workflow run URL
- workflow head SHA
- `desktop_v<version>` tag
- GitHub release URL
- whether CrabNebula publish completed
- changelog URL
- stable DMG SHA-256
- installed stable critical-QA PASS

If the workflow fails, inspect the failed job logs with:

```bash
gh run view <run-id> --log-failed
```

After the workflow succeeds, follow the QA skill's post-publish stable gate:
download the matching DMG from the GitHub release, install it, and use Computer
Use to repeat the core checks. Do not declare the release complete until both
the stable workflow and installed stable QA succeed.
